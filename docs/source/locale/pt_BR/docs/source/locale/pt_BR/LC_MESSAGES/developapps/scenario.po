"MagnetoCorp is a well-respected company that makes self-driving electric "
"vehicles. In early April 2020, MagnetoCorp won a large order to "
"manufacture 10,000 Model D cars for Daintree, a new entrant in the "
"personal transport market. Although the order represents a significant "
"win for MagnetoCorp, Daintree will not have to pay for the vehicles until"
" they start to be delivered on November 1, six months after the deal was "
"formally agreed between MagnetoCorp and Daintree."

"To manufacture the vehicles, MagnetoCorp will need to hire 1000 workers "
"for at least 6 months. This puts a short term strain on its finances -- "
"it will require an extra 5M USD each month to pay these new employees. "
"Commercial paper is designed to help MagnetoCorp overcome its short term "
"financing needs -- to meet payroll every month based on the expectation "
"that it will be cash rich when Daintree starts to pay for its new Model D"
" cars."

"At the end of May, MagnetoCorp needs 5M USD to meet payroll for the extra"
" workers it hired on May 1. To do this, it issues a commercial paper with"
" a face value of 5M USD with a maturity date 6 months in the future -- "
"when it expects to see cash flow from Daintree. DigiBank thinks that "
"MagnetoCorp is creditworthy, and therefore doesn't require much of a "
"premium above the central bank base rate of 2%, which would value 4.95M "
"USD today at 5M USD in 6 months time. It therefore purchases the "
"MagnetoCorp 6 month commercial paper for 4.94M USD -- a slight discount "
"compared to the 4.95M USD it is worth. DigiBank fully expects that it "
"will be able to redeem 5M USD from MagnetoCorp in 6 months time, making "
"it a profit of 10K USD for bearing the increased risk associated with "
"this commercial paper. This extra 10K means it receives a 2.4% return on "
"investment -- significantly better than the risk free return of 2%."

"At the end of June, when MagnetoCorp issues a new commercial paper for 5M"
" USD to meet June's payroll, it is purchased by BigFund for 4.94M USD.  "
"That's because the commercial conditions are roughly the same in June as "
"they are in May, resulting in BigFund valuing MagnetoCorp commercial "
"paper at the same price that DigiBank did in May."

"Each subsequent month, MagnetoCorp can issue new commercial paper to meet"
" its payroll obligations, and these may be purchased by DigiBank, or any "
"other participant in the PaperNet commercial paper network -- BigFund, "
"HedgeMatic or BrokerHouse. These organizations may pay more or less for "
"the commercial paper depending on two factors -- the central bank base "
"rate, and the risk associated with MagnetoCorp. This latter figure "
"depends on a variety of factors such as the production of Model D cars, "
"and the creditworthiness of MagnetoCorp as assessed by RateM, a ratings "
"agency."

"The organizations in PaperNet have different roles, MagnetoCorp issues "
"paper, DigiBank, BigFund, HedgeMatic and BrokerHouse trade paper and "
"RateM rates paper. Organizations of the same role, such as DigiBank, "
"Bigfund, HedgeMatic and BrokerHouse are competitors. Organizations of "
"different roles are not necessarily competitors, yet might still have "
"opposing business interest, for example MagentoCorp will desire a high "
"rating for its papers to sell them at a high price, while DigiBank would "
"benefit from a low rating, such that it can buy them at a low price. As "
"can be seen, even a seemingly simple network such as PaperNet can have "
"complex trust relationships. A blockchain can help establish trust among "
"organizations that are competitors or have opposing business interests "
"that might lead to disputes. Fabric in particular has the means to "
"capture even fine-grained trust relationships."

"Let's pause the MagnetoCorp story for a moment, and develop the client "
"applications and smart contracts that PaperNet uses to issue, buy, sell "
"and redeem commercial paper as well as capture the trust relationships "
"between the organizations.  We'll come back to the role of the rating "
"agency, RateM, a little later."
