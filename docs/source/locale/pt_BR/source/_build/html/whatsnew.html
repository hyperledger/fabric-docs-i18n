<h1>What’s new in Hyperledger Fabric v2.x<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-new-in-hyperledger-fabric-v2-x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The first Hyperledger Fabric major release since v1.0, Fabric v2.0
delivers important new features and changes for users and operators alike,
including support for new application and privacy patterns, enhanced
governance around smart contracts, and new options for operating nodes.</p>
<p>Each v2.x minor release builds on the v2.0 release with minor features,
improvements, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the highlights of the Fabric v2.0 release…</p>
<div class="section" id="decentralized-governance-for-smart-contracts">
<h2>Decentralized governance for smart contracts<a class="headerlink" href="#decentralized-governance-for-smart-contracts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fabric v2.0 introduces decentralized governance for smart contracts, with a new
process for installing a chaincode on your peers and starting it on a channel.
The new Fabric chaincode lifecycle allows multiple organizations to come to
agreement on the parameters of a chaincode, such as the chaincode endorsement
policy, before it can be used to interact with the ledger. The new model
offers several improvements over the previous lifecycle:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Multiple organizations must agree to the parameters of a chaincode</strong>
In the release 1.x versions of Fabric, one organization had the ability to
set parameters of a chaincode (for instance the endorsement policy) for all
other channel members, who only had the power to refuse to install the chaincode
and therefore not take part in transactions invoking it. The new Fabric
chaincode lifecycle is more flexible since it supports both centralized
trust models (such as that of the previous lifecycle model) as well as
decentralized models requiring a sufficient number of organizations to
agree on an endorsement policy and other details before the chaincode
becomes active on a channel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More deliberate chaincode upgrade process</strong> In the previous chaincode
lifecycle, the upgrade transaction could be issued by a single organization,
creating a risk for a channel member that had not yet installed the new
chaincode. The new model allows for a chaincode to be upgraded only after
a sufficient number of organizations have approved the upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simpler endorsement policy and private data collection updates</strong>
Fabric lifecycle allows you to change an endorsement policy or private
data collection configuration without having to repackage or reinstall
the chaincode. Users can also take advantage of a new default endorsement
policy that requires endorsement from a majority of organizations on the
channel. This policy is updated automatically when organizations are
added or removed from the channel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inspectable chaincode packages</strong> The Fabric lifecycle packages chaincode
in easily readable tar files. This makes it easier to inspect the chaincode
package and coordinate installation across multiple organizations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start multiple chaincodes on a channel using one package</strong> The previous
lifecycle defined each chaincode on the channel using a name and version
that was specified when the chaincode package was installed. You can now
use a single chaincode package and deploy it multiple times with different
names on the same channel or on different channels. For example, if you’d
like to track different types of assets in their own ‘copy’ of the chaincode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chaincode packages do not need to be identical across channel members</strong>
Organizations can extend a chaincode for their own use case, for example
to perform different validations in the interest of their organization.
As long as the required number of organizations endorse chaincode transactions
with matching results, the transaction will be validated and committed to the
ledger.  This also allows organizations to individually roll out minor fixes
on their own schedules without requiring the entire network to proceed in lock-step.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="using-the-new-chaincode-lifecycle">
<h3>Using the new chaincode lifecycle<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-new-chaincode-lifecycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For existing Fabric deployments, you can continue to use the prior chaincode
lifecycle with Fabric v2.0. The new chaincode lifecycle will become effective
only when the channel application capability is updated to v2.0.
See the <a class="reference internal" href="chaincode_lifecycle.html"><span class="doc">&lt;no title&gt;</span></a> concept topic for an overview of the new
chaincode lifecycle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-chaincode-application-patterns-for-collaboration-and-consensus">
<h2>New chaincode application patterns for collaboration and consensus<a class="headerlink" href="#new-chaincode-application-patterns-for-collaboration-and-consensus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The same decentralized methods of coming to agreement that underpin the
new chaincode lifecycle management can also be used in your own chaincode
applications to ensure organizations consent to data transactions before
they are committed to the ledger.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Automated checks</strong> As mentioned above, organizations can add automated
checks to chaincode functions to validate additional information before
endorsing a transaction proposal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decentralized agreement</strong> Human decisions can be modeled into a chaincode process
that spans multiple transactions. The chaincode may require actors from
various organizations to indicate their terms and conditions of agreement
in a ledger transaction. Then, a final chaincode proposal can
verify that the conditions from all the individual transactors are met,
and “settle” the business transaction with finality across all channel
members. For a concrete example of indicating terms and conditions in private,
see the asset transfer scenario in the <a class="reference internal" href="private-data/private-data.html"><span class="doc">&lt;no title&gt;</span></a> documentation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="private-data-enhancements">
<h2>Private data enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#private-data-enhancements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Fabric v2.0 also enables new patterns for working with and sharing private data,
without the requirement of creating private data collections for all
combinations of channel members that may want to transact. Specifically,
instead of sharing private data within a collection of multiple members,
you may want to share private data across collections, where each collection
may include a single organization, or perhaps a single organization along
with a regulator or auditor.</p>
<p>Several enhancements in Fabric v2.0 make these new private data patterns possible:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Sharing and verifying private data</strong> When private data is shared with a
channel member who is not a member of a collection, or shared with another
private data collection that contains one or more channel members (by writing
a key to that collection), the receiving parties can utilize the
GetPrivateDataHash() chaincode API to verify that the private data matches the
on-chain hashes that were created from private data in previous transactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collection-level endorsement policies</strong> Private data collections can now
optionally be defined with an endorsement policy that overrides the
chaincode-level endorsement policy for keys within the collection. This
feature can be used to restrict which organizations can write data to a
collection, and is what enables the new chaincode lifecycle and chaincode
application patterns mentioned earlier. For example, you may have a chaincode
endorsement policy that requires a majority of organizations to endorse,
but for any given transaction, you may need two transacting organizations
to individually endorse their agreement in their own private data collections.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implicit per-organization collections</strong> If you’d like to utilize
per-organization private data patterns, you don’t even need to define the
collections when deploying chaincode in Fabric v2.0.  Implicit
organization-specific collections can be used without any upfront definition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about the new private data patterns, see the <a class="reference internal" href="private-data/private-data.html"><span class="doc">&lt;no title&gt;</span></a> (conceptual
documentation). For details about private data collection configuration and
implicit collections, see the <a class="reference internal" href="private-data-arch.html"><span class="doc">Private Data</span></a> (reference documentation).</p>

<div class="section" id="external-chaincode-launcher">
<h2>External chaincode launcher<a class="headerlink" href="#external-chaincode-launcher" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The external chaincode launcher feature empowers operators to build and launch
chaincode with the technology of their choice. Use of external builders and launchers
is not required as the default behavior builds and runs chaincode in the same manner
as prior releases using the Docker API.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Eliminate Docker daemon dependency</strong> Prior releases of Fabric required
peers to have access to a Docker daemon in order to build and launch
chaincode - something that may not be desirable in production environments
due to the privileges required by the peer process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternatives to containers</strong> Chaincode is no longer required to be run
in Docker containers, and may be executed in the operator’s choice of
environment (including containers).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>External builder executables</strong> An operator can provide a set of external
builder executables to override how the peer builds and launches chaincode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chaincode as an external service</strong> Traditionally, chaincodes are launched
by the peer, and then connect back to the peer. It is now possible to run chaincode as
an external service, for example in a Kubernetes pod, which a peer can
connect to and utilize for chaincode execution. See <a class="reference internal" href="cc_service.html"><span class="doc">}</span></a> for more
information.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="cc_launcher.html"><span class="doc">fi</span></a> to learn more about the external chaincode launcher feature.</p>

<h2>State database cache for improved performance on CouchDB<a class="headerlink" href="#state-database-cache-for-improved-performance-on-couchdb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When using external CouchDB state database, read delays during endorsement
and validation phases have historically been a performance bottleneck.</p></li>
<li><p>With Fabric v2.0, a new peer cache replaces many of these expensive lookups
with fast local cache reads. The cache size can be configured by using the
core.yaml property <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cacheSize</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="alpine-based-docker-images">
<h2>Alpine-based docker images<a class="headerlink" href="#alpine-based-docker-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Starting with v2.0, Hyperledger Fabric Docker images will use Alpine Linux,
a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution. This means that Docker
images are now much smaller, providing faster download and startup times,
as well as taking up less disk space on host systems. Alpine Linux is designed
from the ground up with security in mind, and the minimalist nature of the Alpine
distribution greatly reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.</p>

<div class="section" id="sample-test-network">
<h2>Sample test network<a class="headerlink" href="#sample-test-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fabric-samples repository now includes a new Fabric test network. The test
network is built to be a modular and user friendly sample Fabric network that
makes it easy to test your applications and smart contracts. The network also
supports the ability to deploy your network using Certificate Authorities,
in addition to cryptogen.</p>

<p>A major new release brings some additional upgrade considerations. Rest assured
though, that rolling upgrades from v1.4.x to v2.x are supported, so that network
components can be upgraded one at a time with no downtime.</p>
