<h1>Glossary<a class="headerlink" href="#glossary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Terminology is verry important, so that all Hyperledger Fabric users and developers

example. The documentation will reference the glossary as needed, but feel free

<div class="section" id="anchor-peer">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Anchor Peer<a class="headerlink" href="#anchor-peer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Used by gossip to make sure peers in different organizations know about each other.</p>
<p>When a configuration block that contains an update to the anchor peers is committed,
peers reach out to the anchor peers and learn from them about all of the peers known
to the anchor peer(s). Once at least one peer from each organization has contacted an
anchor peer, the anchor peer learns about every peer in the channel. Since gossip
communication is constant, and because peers always ask to be told about the existence
of any peer they don’t know about, a common view of membership can be established for
a channel.</p>
<p>For example, let’s assume we have three organizations — <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code> — in the channel
and a single anchor peer — <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgC</span></code> — defined for organization <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code>.
When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer1.orgA</span></code> (from organization <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>) contacts <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgC</span></code>, it will
tell <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgC</span></code> about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgA</span></code>. And when at a later time <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer1.orgB</span></code>
contacts <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgC</span></code>, the latter would tell the former about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgB</span></code>.
From that point forward, organizations <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code> would start exchanging
membership information directly without any assistance from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">peer0.orgC</span></code>.</p>
<p>As communication across organizations depends on gossip in order to work, there must
be at least one anchor peer defined in the channel configuration. It is strongly
recommended that every organization provides its own set of anchor peers for high
availability and redundancy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="acl">
<span id="glossary-acl"></span><h2>ACL<a class="headerlink" href="#acl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An ACL, or Access Control List, associates access to specific peer
resources (such as system chaincode APIs or event services) to a <a class="reference internal" href="#policy">Policy</a>
(which specifies how many and what types of organizations or roles are
required). The ACL is part of a channel’s configuration. It is therefore
persisted in the channel’s configuration blocks, and can be updated using the
standard configuration update mechanism.</p>
<p>An ACL is formatted as a list of key-value pairs, where the key identifies
the resource whose access we wish to control, and the value identifies the
channel policy (group) that is allowed to access it. For example
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lscc/GetDeploymentSpec:</span> <span class="pre">/Channel/Application/Readers</span></code>
defines that the access to the life cycle chaincode <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GetDeploymentSpec</span></code> API
(the resource) is accessible by identities which satisfy the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/Channel/Application/Readers</span></code> policy.</p>
<p>A set of default ACLs is provided in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configtx.yaml</span></code> file which is
used by configtxgen to build channel configurations. The defaults can be set
in the top level “Application” section of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">configtx.yaml</span></code> or overridden
on a per profile basis in the “Profiles” section.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A block contains an ordered set of transactions. It is cryptographically linked
to the preceding block, and in turn it is linked to be subsequent blocks. The
first block in such a chain of blocks is called the <strong>genesis block</strong>. Blocks
are created by the ordering service, and then validated and committed by peers.</p>

<p>The ledger’s chain is a transaction log structured as hash-linked blocks of
transactions. Peers receive blocks of transactions from the ordering service, mark
the block’s transactions as valid or invalid based on endorsement policies and
concurrency violations, and append the block to the hash chain on the peer’s
file system.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A channel is a private blockchain overlay which allows for data
isolation and confidentiality. A channel-specific ledger is shared across the
peers in the channel, and transacting parties must be authenticated to
a channel in order to interact with it.  Channels are defined by a

<p>Each <a class="reference internal" href="#peer">Peer</a> on a channel validates ordered blocks of
transactions and then commits (writes/appends) the blocks to its replica of the
channel <a class="reference internal" href="#ledger">Ledger</a>. Peers also mark each transaction in each block

<div class="section" id="concurrency-control-version-check">
<span id="id7"></span><h2>Concurrency Control Version Check<a class="headerlink" href="#concurrency-control-version-check" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Concurrency Control Version Check is a method of keeping ledger state in sync across
peers on a channel. Peers execute transactions in parallel, and before committing
to the ledger, peers check whether the state read at the time the transaction was executed
has been modified. If the data read for the transaction has changed between execution time and
commit time, then a Concurrency Control Version Check violation has
occurred, and the transaction is marked as invalid on the ledger and values
are not updated in the state database.</p>

<p>Contains the configuration data defining members and policies for a system
chain (ordering service) or channel. Any configuration modifications to a
channel or overall network (e.g. a member leaving or joining) will result
in a new configuration block being appended to the appropriate chain. This
block will contain the contents of the genesis block, plus the delta.</p>

<div class="section" id="consensus">
<span id="id9"></span><h2>Consensus<a class="headerlink" href="#consensus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A broader term overarching the entire transactional flow, which serves to generate

constituting a block.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consenter-set">
<span id="id10"></span><h2>Consenter set<a class="headerlink" href="#consenter-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a Raft ordering service, these are the ordering nodes actively participating
in the consensus mechanism on a channel. If other ordering nodes exist on the
system channel, but are not a part of a channel, they are not part of that
channel’s consenter set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="consortium">
<span id="id11"></span><h2>Consortium<a class="headerlink" href="#consortium" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A consortium is a collection of non-orderer organizations on the blockchain
network. These are the organizations that form and join channels and that own
peers. While a blockchain network can have multiple consortia, most blockchain
networks have a single consortium. At channel creation time, all organizations
added to the channel must be part of a consortium. However, an organization
that is not defined in a consortium may be added to an existing channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chaincode-definition">
<span id="id12"></span><h2>Chaincode definition<a class="headerlink" href="#chaincode-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A chaincode definition is used by organizations to agree on the parameters of a
chaincode before it can be used on a channel. Each channel member that wants to
use the chaincode to endorse transactions or query the ledger needs to approve
a chaincode definition for their organization. Once enough channel members have
approved a chaincode definition to meet the Lifecycle Endorsement policy (which
is set to a majority of organizations in the channel by default), the chaincode
definition can be committed to the channel. After the definition is committed,
the first invoke of the chaincode (or, if requested, the execution of the Init
function) will start the chaincode on the channel.</p>

<div class="section" id="dynamic-membership">
<span id="id13"></span><h2>Dynamic Membership<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-membership" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric supports the addition/removal of members, peers, and ordering service
nodes, without compromising the operationality of the overall network. Dynamic
membership is critical when business relationships adjust and entities need to
be added/removed for various reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="endorsement">
<span id="id14"></span><h2>Endorsement<a class="headerlink" href="#endorsement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Refers to the process where specific peer nodes execute a chaincode transaction and return
a proposal response to the client application. The proposal response includes the
chaincode execution response message, results (read set and write set), and events,
as well as a signature to serve as proof of the peer’s chaincode execution.
Chaincode applications have corresponding endorsement policies, in which the endorsing
peers are specified.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="endorsement-policy">
<span id="id15"></span><h2>Endorsement policy<a class="headerlink" href="#endorsement-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Defines the peer nodes on a channel that must execute transactions attached to a
specific chaincode application, and the required combination of responses (endorsements).
A policy could require that a transaction be endorsed by a minimum number of
endorsing peers, a minimum percentage of endorsing peers, or by all endorsing
peers that are assigned to a specific chaincode application. Policies can be
curated based on the application and the desired level of resilience against
misbehavior (deliberate or not) by the endorsing peers. A transaction that is submitted
must satisfy the endorsement policy before being marked as valid by committing peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follower">
<span id="id16"></span><h2>Follower<a class="headerlink" href="#follower" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a leader based consensus protocol, such as Raft, these are the nodes which
replicate log entries produced by the leader. In Raft, the followers also receive
“heartbeat” messages from the leader. In the event that the leader stops sending
those message for a configurable amount of time, the followers will initiate a
leader election and one of them will be elected leader.</p>

</div>
<p>A ledger consists of two distinct, though related, parts – a “blockchain” and
the “state database”, also known as “world state”. Unlike other ledgers,
blockchains are <strong>immutable</strong> – that is, once a block has been added to the
chain, it cannot be changed. In contrast, the “world state” is a database
containing the current value of the set of key-value pairs that have been added,
modified or deleted by the set of validated and committed transactions in the
blockchain.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to think of there being one <strong>logical</strong> ledger for each channel in
the network. In reality, each peer in a channel maintains its own copy of the
ledger – which is kept consistent with every other peer’s copy through a
process called <strong>consensus</strong>. The term <strong>Distributed Ledger Technology</strong>
(<strong>DLT</strong>) is often associated with this kind of ledger – one that is logically
singular, but has many identical copies distributed across a set of network
nodes (peers and the ordering service).</p>

<p>The Membership Service Provider (MSP) refers to an abstract component of the
system that provides credentials to clients, and peers for them to participate
in a Hyperledger Fabric network. Clients use these credentials to authenticate
their transactions, and peers use these credentials to authenticate transaction
processing results (endorsements). While strongly connected to the transaction
processing components of the systems, this interface aims to have membership
services components defined, in such a way that alternate implementations of
this can be smoothly plugged in without modifying the core of transaction
processing components of the system.</p>

the client application will typically not submit these read-only transactions for ordering,

<p>Also known as the “current state”, the world state is a component of the
HyperLedger Fabric <a class="reference internal" href="#ledger"><span class="std std-ref">Ledger</span></a>. The world state represents the latest values
for all keys included in the chain transaction log. Chaincode executes
transaction proposals against world state data because the world state provides
direct access to the latest value of these keys rather than having to calculate
them by traversing the entire transaction log. The world state will change
every time the value of a key changes (for example, when the ownership of a
car – the “key” – is transferred from one owner to another – the
“value”) or when a new key is added (a car is created). As a result, the world
state is critical to a transaction flow, since the current state of a key-value
pair must be known before it can be changed. Peers commit the latest values to
the ledger world state for each valid transaction included in a processed block.</p>
