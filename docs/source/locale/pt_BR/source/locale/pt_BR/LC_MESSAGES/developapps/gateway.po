"You might ask yourself whether a static or dynamic gateway is better? The"

"unchanging. In this sense they are predictable -- they will always use "
"the same peers and orderers if they are available. Dynamic networks are "
"more responsive as they understand how the network changes -- they can "
"use newly added peers and orderers, which brings extra resilience and "
"scalability, at potentially some cost in predictability. In general it's "
