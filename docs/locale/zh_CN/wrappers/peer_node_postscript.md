## Example Usage

### peer node start example

The following command:

```
peer node start --peer-chaincodedev
```

starts a peer node in chaincode development mode. Normally chaincode containers are started
and maintained by peer. However in chaincode development mode, chaincode is built and started by the user. This mode is useful during chaincode development phase for iterative development.
See more information on development mode in the [chaincode tutorial](../chaincode4ade.html).
