"A connection profile contains a description of a network view, expressed "

"connection profile."

"A connection profile should not be an exhaustive description of a network"

"A static connection profile is normally created by an administrator who "

"By configuring a gateway with this connection profile, the issue "

"It's good practice for a connection profile to define more than one peer "

"A DigiBank buy application would typically configure its gateway with a "
