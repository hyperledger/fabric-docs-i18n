"As the upgrading of nodes and increasing the capability levels of "

"It is a best practice to upgrade your SDK to the latest version as a part"
" of a general upgrade of your network. While the SDK will always be "
"compatible with equivalent releases of Fabric and lower, it might be "
"necessary to upgrade to the latest SDK to leverage the latest Fabric "
"features. Consult the documentation of the Fabric SDK you are using for "
"information about how to upgrade."
