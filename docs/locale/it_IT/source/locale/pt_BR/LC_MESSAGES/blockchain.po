"Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions "
"underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of "
"confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility, and scalability. It is designed"
" to support pluggable implementations of different components and "
"accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist across the economic"
" ecosystem."

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:21
msgid ""
"At the heart of a blockchain network is a distributed ledger that records"
" all the transactions that take place on the network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:24
msgid ""
"A blockchain ledger is often described as **decentralized** because it is"
" replicated across many network participants, each of whom "
"**collaborate** in its maintenance. We’ll see that decentralization and "
"collaboration are powerful attributes that mirror the way businesses "
"exchange goods and services in the real world."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:31
msgid ""
"In addition to being decentralized and collaborative, the information "
"recorded to a blockchain is append-only, using cryptographic techniques "
"that guarantee that once a transaction has been added to the ledger it "
"cannot be modified. This property of \"immutability\" makes it simple to "
"determine the provenance of information because participants can be sure "
"information has not been changed after the fact. It’s why blockchains are"
" sometimes described as **systems of proof**."

msgid "**Smart Contracts**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:40
msgid ""
"To support the consistent update of information --- and to enable a whole"
" host of ledger functions (transacting, querying, etc) --- a blockchain "
"network uses **smart contracts** to provide controlled access to the "
"ledger."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:46
msgid ""
"Smart contracts are not only a key mechanism for encapsulating "
"information and keeping it simple across the network, they can also be "
"written to allow participants to execute certain aspects of transactions "
"automatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:50
msgid ""
"A smart contract can, for example, be written to stipulate the cost of "
"shipping an item where the shipping charge changes depending on how "
"quickly the item arrives. With the terms agreed to by both parties and "
"written to the ledger, the appropriate funds change hands automatically "
"when the item is received."

msgid "**Consensus**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:57
msgid ""
"The process of keeping the ledger transactions synchronized across the "
"network --- to ensure that ledgers update only when transactions are "
"approved by the appropriate participants, and that when ledgers do "
"update, they update with the same transactions in the same order --- is "
"called **consensus**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:64
msgid ""
"You'll learn a lot more about ledgers, smart contracts and consensus "
"later. For now, it’s enough to think of a blockchain as a shared, "
"replicated transaction system which is updated via smart contracts and "
"kept consistently synchronized through a collaborative process called "
"consensus."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:74
msgid ""
"The transactional networks of today are little more than slightly updated"
" versions of networks that have existed since business records have been "
"kept. The members of a **business network** transact with each other, but"
" they maintain separate records of their transactions. And the things "
"they’re transacting --- whether it’s Flemish tapestries in the 16th "
"century or the securities of today --- must have their provenance "
"established each time they’re sold to ensure that the business selling an"
" item possesses a chain of title verifying their ownership of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "What you’re left with is a business network that looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:87
msgid ""
"Modern technology has taken this process from stone tablets and paper "
"folders to hard drives and cloud platforms, but the underlying structure "
"is the same. Unified systems for managing the identity of network "
"participants do not exist, establishing provenance is so laborious it "
"takes days to clear securities transactions (the world volume of which is"
" numbered in the many trillions of dollars), contracts must be signed and"
" executed manually, and every database in the system contains unique "
"information and therefore represents a single point of failure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:96
msgid ""
"It’s impossible with today’s fractured approach to information and "
"process sharing to build a system of record that spans a business "
"network, even though the needs of visibility and trust are clear."

msgid "**The Blockchain Difference**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:102
msgid ""
"What if, instead of the rat’s nest of inefficiencies represented by the "
"“modern” system of transactions, business networks had standard methods "
"for establishing identity on the network, executing transactions, and "
"storing data? What if establishing the provenance of an asset could be "
"determined by looking through a list of transactions that, once written, "
"cannot be changed, and can therefore be trusted?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:109
msgid "That business network would look more like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:113
msgid ""
"This is a blockchain network, wherein every participant has their own "
"replicated copy of the ledger. In addition to ledger information being "
"shared, the processes which update the ledger are also shared. Unlike "
"today’s systems, where a participant’s **private** programs are used to "
"update their **private** ledgers, a blockchain system has **shared** "
"programs to update **shared** ledgers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:119
msgid ""
"With the ability to coordinate their business network through a shared "
"ledger, blockchain networks can reduce the time, cost, and risk "
"associated with private information and processing while improving trust "
"and visibility."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:123
msgid ""
"You now know what blockchain is and why it’s useful. There are a lot of "
"other details that are important, but they all relate to these "

msgid "What is Hyperledger Fabric?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:130
msgid ""
"The Linux Foundation founded the Hyperledger project in 2015 to advance "
"cross-industry blockchain technologies. Rather than declaring a single "
"blockchain standard, it encourages a collaborative approach to developing"
" blockchain technologies via a community process, with intellectual "
"property rights that encourage open development and the adoption of key "
"standards over time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:137
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric is one of the blockchain projects within Hyperledger. "
"Like other blockchain technologies, it has a ledger, uses smart "
"contracts, and is a system by which participants manage their "
"transactions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:141
msgid ""
"Where Hyperledger Fabric breaks from some other blockchain systems is "
"that it is **private** and **permissioned**. Rather than an open "
"permissionless system that allows unknown identities to participate in "
"the network (requiring protocols like \"proof of work\" to validate "
"transactions and secure the network), the members of a Hyperledger Fabric"
" network enroll through a trusted **Membership Service Provider (MSP)**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:147
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric also offers several pluggable options. Ledger data can"
" be stored in multiple formats, consensus mechanisms can be swapped in "
"and out, and different MSPs are supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:151
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric also offers the ability to create **channels**, "
"allowing a group of participants to create a separate ledger of "
"transactions. This is an especially important option for networks where "
"some participants might be competitors and not want every transaction "
"they make --- a special price they're offering to some participants and "
"not others, for example --- known to every participant. If two "
"participants form a channel, then those participants --- and no others "
"--- have copies of the ledger for that channel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:159
msgid "**Shared Ledger**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:161
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric has a ledger subsystem comprising two components: the "
"**world state** and the **transaction log**. Each participant has a copy "
"of the ledger to every Hyperledger Fabric network they belong to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:165
msgid ""
"The world state component describes the state of the ledger at a given "
"point in time. It’s the database of the ledger. The transaction log "
"component records all transactions which have resulted in the current "
"value of the world state; it’s the update history for the world state. "
"The ledger, then, is a combination of the world state database and the "
"transaction log history."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:171
msgid ""
"The ledger has a replaceable data store for the world state. By default, "
"this is a LevelDB key-value store database. The transaction log does not "
"need to be pluggable. It simply records the before and after values of "
"the ledger database being used by the blockchain network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:178
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts are written in **chaincode** and are "
"invoked by an application external to the blockchain when that "
"application needs to interact with the ledger. In most cases, chaincode "
"interacts only with the database component of the ledger, the world state"
" (querying it, for example), and not the transaction log."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:184
msgid ""
"Chaincode can be implemented in several programming languages. Currently,"
" Go and Node are supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:187
msgid "**Privacy**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:189
msgid ""
"Depending on the needs of a network, participants in a Business-to-"
"Business (B2B) network might be extremely sensitive about how much "
"information they share. For other networks, privacy will not be a top "
"concern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:193
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric supports networks where privacy (using channels) is a "
"key operational requirement as well as networks that are comparatively "
"open."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:198
msgid ""
"Transactions must be written to the ledger in the order in which they "
"occur, even though they might be between different sets of participants "
"within the network. For this to happen, the order of transactions must be"
" established and a method for rejecting bad transactions that have been "
"inserted into the ledger in error (or maliciously) must be put into "
"place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:204
msgid ""
"This is a thoroughly researched area of computer science, and there are "
"many ways to achieve it, each with different trade-offs. For example, "
"PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) can provide a mechanism for "
"file replicas to communicate with each other to keep each copy "
"consistent, even in the event of corruption. Alternatively, in Bitcoin, "
"ordering happens through a process called mining where competing "
"computers race to solve a cryptographic puzzle which defines the order "
"that all processes subsequently build upon."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/blockchain.rst:212
msgid ""
"Hyperledger Fabric has been designed to allow network starters to choose "
"a consensus mechanism that best represents the relationships that exist "
"between participants. As with privacy, there is a spectrum of needs; from"
" networks that are highly structured in their relationships to those that"
" are more peer-to-peer."
