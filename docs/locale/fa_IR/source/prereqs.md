# Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to run a Docker-based Fabric test network on your local machine.

## Mac

<!--- Indent entire section -->
<div style="margin-left: 1.5em;">

### Homebrew

For macOS, we recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to manage the prereqs.

```shell
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
$ brew --version
Homebrew 2.5.2
```

The Xcode command line tools will be installed as part of the Homebrew installation.
Once Homebrew is ready, installing the necessary prerequisites is very easy:

### Git

Install the latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it is not already installed.

```shell
$ brew install git
$ git --version
git version 2.23.0
```

### cURL

Install the latest version of [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) if it is not already installed.

```shell
$ brew install curl
$ curl --version
curl 7.64.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin19.0) libcurl/7.64.1 (SecureTransport) LibreSSL/2.8.3 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.39.2
Release-Date: 2019-03-27
```

### Docker

Install the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not already installed.
Since Docker Desktop is a UI application on Mac, use `cask` to install it.

Homebrew v2.x:

```shell
$ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" docker
```

Homebrew v3.x:

```shell
$ brew install --cask --appdir="/Applications" docker
```

Docker Desktop must be launched to complete the installation so be sure to open the application after installing it:

```shell
$ open /Applications/Docker.app
```

Once installed, confirm the latest versions of both `docker` and `docker-compose` executables were installed.

```shell
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.27.2, build 18f557f9
```

> **Note:** Some users have reported errors while running Fabric-Samples with the Docker Desktop `gRPC FUSE for file sharing` option checked.
> Please uncheck this option in your Docker Preferences to continue using `osxfs for file sharing`.

### Go

Optional: Install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if it is not already installed
(only required if you will be writing Go chaincode or SDK applications).

```shell
$ brew install go
$ go version
go1.15.7 darwin/amd64
```

### JQ

Optional: Install the latest version of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) if it is not already installed
(only required for the tutorials related to channel configuration transactions).

```shell
$ brew install jq
$ jq --version
jq-1.6
```

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install docker-compose
```

Once installed, confirm that the latest versions of both Docker and Docker Compose executables were installed.

```shell
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.27.2, build 18f557f9
```

Make sure the Docker daemon is running.

```shell
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Optional: If you want the Docker daemon to start when the system starts, use the following:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Add your user to the Docker group.

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G docker <username>
```

### Git

Install the latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if it is not already installed.
To use `Fabric binaries`, you will need to have the `uname` command available. You can get it as part of `Git` but beware that only the 64bit version is supported.

Update the following `git` configurations
```shell
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

You can check the setting of these parameters with the following commands:
```shell
git config --get core.autocrlf
git config --get core.longpaths
```

These need to be false and true respectively.

### cURL

Install the latest version of [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) if it is not already installed.

### Docker

Install the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if it is not already installed.

Once installed, confirm the latest versions of both Docker and Docker Compose executables were installed.

### Go

Optional: Install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) if it is not already installed
(only required if you will be writing Go chaincode or SDK applications).

### JQ

Optional: Install the latest version of [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) if it is not already installed.
(only required for the tutorials related to channel configuration transactions).

## **Notes**

- The `cURL` command that comes with Git and Docker Toolbox is old and does not handle properly the redirect used in [Getting Started](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html). Please make sure you use a newer version from the [cURL downloads page](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
- These prerequisites are recommended for Fabric users. If you are a Fabric developer, please refer to the instructions for [Setting up the development environment](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-setup/devenv.html).
