This topic covers how to develop a client application and smart contract to
solve a business problem using Hyperledger Fabric. In a real world **Commercial
Paper** scenario, involving multiple organizations, you'll learn about all the
concepts and tasks required to accomplish this goal. We assume that the
blockchain network is already available.

The topic is designed for multiple audiences:

* Solution and application architect
* Client application developer
* Smart contract developer
* Business professional

You can choose to read the topic in order, or you can select individual sections
as appropriate. Individual topic sections are marked according to reader
relevance, so whether you're looking for business or technical information it'll
be clear when a topic is for you.

The topic follows a typical software development lifecycle. It starts with
business requirements, and then covers all the major technical activities
required to develop an application and smart contract to meet these
requirements.

If you'd prefer, you can try out the commercial paper scenario immediately,
following an abbreviated explanation, by running the commercial paper `tutorial
<../tutorial/commercial_paper.html>`_. You can return to this topic when you
need fuller explanations of the concepts introduced in the tutorial.
