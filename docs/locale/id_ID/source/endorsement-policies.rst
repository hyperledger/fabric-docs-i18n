Endorsement policies
====================

Every chaincode has an endorsement policy which specifies the set of peers on
a channel that must execute chaincode and endorse the execution results in
order for the transaction to be considered valid. These endorsement policies
define the organizations (through their peers) who must "endorse" (i.e., approve
of) the execution of a proposal.

.. note :: Recall that **state**, represented by key-value pairs, is separate
           from blockchain data. For more on this, check out our :doc:`ledger/ledger`
           documentation.

As part of the transaction validation step performed by the peers, each validating
peer checks to make sure that the transaction contains the appropriate **number**
of endorsements and that they are from the expected sources (both of these are
specified in the endorsement policy). The endorsements are also checked to make
sure they're valid (i.e., that they are valid signatures from valid certificates).

Multiple ways to require endorsement
------------------------------------

By default, endorsement policies are specified in the chaincode definition,
which is agreed to by channel members and then committed to a channel (that is,
one endorsement policy covers all of the state associated with a chaincode).

For private data collections, you can also specify an endorsement policy
at the private data collection level, which would override the chaincode
level endorsement policy for any keys in the private data collection, thereby
further restricting which organizations can write to a private data collection.

Finally, there are cases where it may be necessary for a particular public
channel state or private data collection state (a particular key-value pair,
in other words) to have a different endorsement policy.
This **state-based endorsement** allows the chaincode-level or collection-level
endorsement policies to be overridden by a different policy for the specified keys.

To illustrate the circumstances in which the various types of endorsement policies
might be used, consider a channel on which cars are being exchanged. The "creation"
--- also known as "issuance" -- of a car as an asset that can be traded (putting
the key-value pair that represents it into the world state, in other words) would
have to satisfy the chaincode-level endorsement policy. To see how to set a
chaincode-level endorsement policy, check out the section below.

If the key representing the car requires a specific endorsement policy, it can be
defined either when the car is created or afterwards. There are a number of reasons
why it might be necessary or preferable to set a state-specific endorsement policy. The
car might have historical importance or value that makes it necessary to have the
endorsement of a licensed appraiser. Also, the owner of the car (if they're a
member of the channel) might also want to ensure that their peer signs off on a
transaction. In both cases, **an endorsement policy is required for a particular
asset that is different from the default endorsement policies for the other
assets associated with that chaincode.**

We'll show you how to define a state-based endorsement policy in a subsequent
section. But first, let's see how we set a chaincode-level endorsement policy.

Setting chaincode-level endorsement policies
--------------------------------------------

Chaincode-level endorsement policies are agreed to by channel members when they
approve a chaincode definition for their organization. A sufficient number of
channel members need to approve a chaincode definition to meet the
``Channel/Application/LifecycleEndorsement`` policy, which by default is set to
a majority of channel members, before the definition can be committed to the
channel. Once the definition has been committed, the chaincode is ready to use.
Any invoke of the chaincode that writes data to the ledger will need to be
validated by enough channel members to meet the endorsement policy.

You can create an endorsement policy from
your CLI when you approve and commit a chaincode definition with the Fabric peer
binaries by using the ``--signature-policy`` flag.

.. note:: Don't worry about the policy syntax (``'Org1.member'``, et all) right
          now. We'll talk more about the syntax in the next section.

For example:

::

    peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg --channelID mychannel --signature-policy "AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')" --name mycc --version 1.0 --package-id mycc_1:3a8c52d70c36313cfebbaf09d8616e7a6318ababa01c7cbe40603c373bcfe173 --sequence 1 --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem --waitForEvent

The above command approves the chaincode definition of ``mycc`` with the policy
``AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')`` which would require that a member of both
Org1 and Org2 sign the transaction. After a sufficient number of channel members
approve a chaincode definition for ``mycc``, the definition and endorsement
policy can be committed to the channel using the command below:

::

    peer lifecycle chaincode commit -o orderer.example.com:7050 --channelID mychannel --signature-policy "AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')" --name mycc --version 1.0 --sequence 1 --init-required --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem --waitForEvent --peerAddresses peer0.org1.example.com:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt --peerAddresses peer0.org2.example.com:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt

Notice that, if the identity classification is enabled (see :doc:`msp`), one can
use the ``PEER`` role to restrict endorsement to only peers.

For example:


::

    peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg --channelID mychannel --signature-policy "AND('Org1.peer', 'Org2.peer')" --name mycc --version 1.0 --package-id mycc_1:3a8c52d70c36313cfebbaf09d8616e7a6318ababa01c7cbe40603c373bcfe173 --sequence 1 --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem --waitForEvent

In addition to the specifying an endorsement policy from the CLI or SDK, a
chaincode can also use policies in the channel configuration as endorsement
policies. You can use the ``--channel-config-policy`` flag to select a channel policy with
format used by the channel configuration and by ACLs.

For example:

::

    peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg --channelID mychannel --channel-config-policy Channel/Application/Admins --name mycc --version 1.0 --package-id mycc_1:3a8c52d70c36313cfebbaf09d8616e7a6318ababa01c7cbe40603c373bcfe173 --sequence 1 --tls --cafile /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem --waitForEvent

If you do not specify a policy, the chaincode definition will use the
``Channel/Application/Endorsement`` policy by default, which requires that a
transaction be validated by a majority of channel members. This policy depends on
the membership of the channel, so it will be updated automatically when organizations
are added or removed from a channel. One advantage of using channel policies is
that they can be written to be updated automatically with channel membership.

If you specify an endorsement policy using the ``--signature-policy`` flag, you will need to update the policy when organizations join or leave the
channel. A new organization added to the channel after the chaincode has been defined
will be able to query a chaincode (provided the query has appropriate authorization as
defined by channel policies and any application level checks enforced by the
chaincode) but will not be able to execute or endorse the chaincode. Only
organizations listed in the endorsement policy syntax will be able sign
transactions.

Endorsement policy syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see above, policies are expressed in terms of principals
("principals" are identities matched to a role). Principals are described as
``'MSP.ROLE'``, where ``MSP`` represents the required MSP ID and ``ROLE``
represents one of the four accepted roles: ``member``, ``admin``, ``client``, and
``peer``.

Here are a few examples of valid principals:

  - ``'Org0.admin'``: any administrator of the ``Org0`` MSP
  - ``'Org1.member'``: any member of the ``Org1`` MSP
  - ``'Org1.client'``: any client of the ``Org1`` MSP
  - ``'Org1.peer'``: any peer of the ``Org1`` MSP

The syntax of the language is:

``EXPR(E[, E...])``

Where ``EXPR`` is either ``AND``, ``OR``, or ``OutOf``, and ``E`` is either a
principal (with the syntax described above) or another nested call to ``EXPR``.

For example:
  - ``AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member', 'Org3.member')`` requests one signature
    from each of the three principals.
  - ``OR('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')`` requests one signature from either one
    of the two principals.
  - ``OR('Org1.member', AND('Org2.member', 'Org3.member'))`` requests either one
    signature from a member of the ``Org1`` MSP or one signature from a member
    of the ``Org2`` MSP and one signature from a member of the ``Org3`` MSP.
  - ``OutOf(1, 'Org1.member', 'Org2.member')``, which resolves to the same thing
    as ``OR('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')``.
  - Similarly, ``OutOf(2, 'Org1.member', 'Org2.member')`` is equivalent to
    ``AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')``, and ``OutOf(2, 'Org1.member',
    'Org2.member', 'Org3.member')`` is equivalent to ``OR(AND('Org1.member',
    'Org2.member'), AND('Org1.member', 'Org3.member'), AND('Org2.member',
    'Org3.member'))``.

Setting collection-level endorsement policies
---------------------------------------------
Similar to chaincode-level endorsement policies, when you approve and commit
a chaincode definition, you can also specify the chaincode's private data collections
and corresponding collection-level endorsement policies. If a collection-level
endorsement policy is set, transactions that write to a private data collection
key will require that the specified organization peers have endorsed the transaction.

You can use collection-level endorsement policies to restrict which organization
peers can write to the private data collection key namespace, for example to
ensure that non-authorized organizations cannot write to a collection, and to
have confidence that any state in a private data collection has been endorsed
by the required collection organization(s).

The collection-level endorsement policy may be less restrictive or more restrictive
than the chaincode-level endorsement policy and the collection's private data
distribution policy.  For example a majority of organizations may be required
to endorse a chaincode transaction, but a specific organization may be required
to endorse a transaction that includes a key in a specific collection.

If you do not specify a collection-level endorsement policy, the chaincode-level
endorsement policy will be applied to protect writes to a private data collection
key namespace. This may be desirable if a set of organizations meeting the chaincode-level
endorsement policy are authorized to create data in other organization's private
data collection. For example if those organizations are trusted to process
transactions but are not authorized to store and later query private data due to industry privacy regulations,
or if the private data is being shared or transferred from one set of organizations
to another through the use of private data collections.
In other scenarios, the private data collection members may
need to be in full control of writes to the private data collection, in which case
a collection-level endorsement policy should be provided.

The syntax for collection-level endorsement policies exactly matches the syntax
for chaincode-level endorsement policies --- in the collection configuration
you can specify an ``endorsementPolicy`` with either a ``signaturePolicy`` or
``channelConfigPolicy``. For more details see :doc:`private-data-arch`.

.. _key-level-endorsement:

Setting key-level endorsement policies
--------------------------------------

Setting regular chaincode-level or collection-level endorsement policies is tied to
the lifecycle of the corresponding chaincode. They can only be set or modified when
defining the chaincode on a channel.

In contrast, key-level endorsement policies can be set and modified in a more
granular fashion from within a chaincode. The modification is part of the
read-write set of a regular transaction.

The shim API provides the following functions to set and retrieve an endorsement
policy for/from a regular key.

.. note:: ``ep`` below stands for the "endorsement policy", which can be expressed
          either by using the same syntax described above or by using the
          convenience function described below. Either method will generate a
          binary version of the endorsement policy that can be consumed by the
          basic shim API.

.. code-block:: Go

    SetStateValidationParameter(key string, ep []byte) error
    GetStateValidationParameter(key string) ([]byte, error)

For keys that are part of :doc:`private-data/private-data` in a collection the
following functions apply:

.. code-block:: Go

    SetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string, ep []byte) error
    GetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string) ([]byte, error)

To help set endorsement policies and marshal them into validation
parameter byte arrays, the Go shim provides an extension with convenience
functions that allow the chaincode developer to deal with endorsement policies
in terms of the MSP identifiers of organizations, see `KeyEndorsementPolicy <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-go/pkg/statebased#KeyEndorsementPolicy>`_:

.. code-block:: Go

    type KeyEndorsementPolicy interface {
        // Policy returns the endorsement policy as bytes
        Policy() ([]byte, error)

        // AddOrgs adds the specified orgs to the list of orgs that are required
        // to endorse
        AddOrgs(roleType RoleType, organizations ...string) error

        // DelOrgs delete the specified channel orgs from the existing key-level endorsement
        // policy for this KVS key. If any org is not present, an error will be returned.
        DelOrgs(organizations ...string) error

        // ListOrgs returns an array of channel orgs that are required to endorse changes
        ListOrgs() ([]string)
    }

For example, to set an endorsement policy for a key where two specific orgs are
required to endorse the key change, pass both org ``MSPIDs`` to ``AddOrgs()``,
and then call ``Policy()`` to construct the endorsement policy byte array that
can be passed to ``SetStateValidationParameter()``.

To add the shim extension to your chaincode as a dependency, see :ref:`vendoring`.

Validation
----------

At commit time, setting a value of a key is no different from setting the
endorsement policy of a key --- both update the state of the key and are
validated based on the same rules.

+---------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| Validation          | no validation parameter set        | validation parameter set |
+=====================+====================================+==========================+
| modify value        | check chaincode or collection ep   | check key-level ep       |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------+
| modify key-level ep | check chaincode or collection ep   | check key-level ep       |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------+

As we discussed above, if a key is modified and no key-level endorsement policy
is present, the chaincode-level or collection-level endorsement policy applies by default.
This is also true when a key-level endorsement policy is set for a key for the first time
--- the new key-level endorsement policy must first be endorsed according to the
pre-existing chaincode-level or collection-level endorsement policy.

If a key is modified and a key-level endorsement policy is present, the key-level
endorsement policy overrides the chaincode-level or collection-level endorsement policy.
In practice, this means that the key-level endorsement policy can be either less restrictive
or more restrictive than the chaincode-level or collection-level endorsement policies.
Because the chaincode-level or collection-level endorsement policy must be satisfied in order
to set a key-level endorsement policy for the first time, no trust assumptions have been violated.

If a key's endorsement policy is removed (set to nil), the chaincode-level
or collection-level endorsement policy becomes the default again.

If a transaction modifies multiple keys with different associated key-level
endorsement policies, all of these policies need to be satisfied in order
for the transaction to be valid.
