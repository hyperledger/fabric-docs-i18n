Security Model
==============

[WIP]

Hyperledger Fabric allows for different organizations and participants
in a common network to utilize their own certificate authority, and as a
byproduct, implement varying cryptographic algorithms for
signing/verifying/identity attestation. This is done through an MSP
process running on both the ordering service and channel levels.

Membership service provider (MSP): A set of cryptographic mechanisms and
protocols for issuing and validating certificates and identities
throughout the blockchain network. Identities issued in the scope of a
membership service provider can be evaluated within that membership
service providerâ€™s rules validation policies.
