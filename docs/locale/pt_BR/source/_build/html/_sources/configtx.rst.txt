Channel Configuration (configtx)
================================

Shared configuration for a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is
stored in a collection configuration transactions, one per channel. Each
configuration transaction is usually referred to by the shorter name
*configtx*.

Channel configuration has the following important properties:

1. **Versioned**: All elements of the configuration have an associated
   version which is advanced with every modification. Further, every
   committed configuration receives a sequence number.
2. **Permissioned**: Each element of the configuration has an associated
   policy which governs whether or not modification to that element is
   permitted. Anyone with a copy of the previous configtx (and no
   additional info) may verify the validity of a new config based on
   these policies.
3. **Hierarchical**: A root configuration group contains sub-groups, and
   each group of the hierarchy has associated values and policies. These
   policies can take advantage of the hierarchy to derive policies at
   one level from policies of lower levels.

Anatomy of a configuration
--------------------------

Configuration is stored as a transaction of type ``HeaderType_CONFIG``
in a block with no other transactions. These blocks are referred to as
*Configuration Blocks*, the first of which is referred to as the
*Genesis Block*.

The proto structures for configuration are stored in
``fabric-protos/common/configtx.proto``. The Envelope of type
``HeaderType_CONFIG`` encodes a ``ConfigEnvelope`` message as the
``Payload`` ``data`` field. The proto for ``ConfigEnvelope`` is defined
as follows:

::

    message ConfigEnvelope {
        Config config = 1;
        Envelope last_update = 2;
    }

The ``last_update`` field is defined below in the **Updates to
configuration** section, but is only necessary when validating the
configuration, not reading it. Instead, the currently committed
configuration is stored in the ``config`` field, containing a ``Config``
message.

::

    message Config {
        uint64 sequence = 1;
        ConfigGroup channel_group = 2;
    }

The ``sequence`` number is incremented by one for each committed
configuration. The ``channel_group`` field is the root group which
contains the configuration. The ``ConfigGroup`` structure is recursively
defined, and builds a tree of groups, each of which contains values and
policies. It is defined as follows:

::

    message ConfigGroup {
        uint64 version = 1;
        map<string,ConfigGroup> groups = 2;
        map<string,ConfigValue> values = 3;
        map<string,ConfigPolicy> policies = 4;
        string mod_policy = 5;
    }

Because ``ConfigGroup`` is a recursive structure, it has hierarchical
arrangement. The following example is expressed for clarity in Go
syntax.

::

    // Assume the following groups are defined
    var root, child1, child2, grandChild1, grandChild2, grandChild3 *ConfigGroup

    // Set the following values
    root.Groups["child1"] = child1
    root.Groups["child2"] = child2
    child1.Groups["grandChild1"] = grandChild1
    child2.Groups["grandChild2"] = grandChild2
    child2.Groups["grandChild3"] = grandChild3

    // The resulting config structure of groups looks like:
    // root:
    //     child1:
    //         grandChild1
    //     child2:
    //         grandChild2
    //         grandChild3

Each group defines a level in the config hierarchy, and each group has
an associated set of values (indexed by string key) and policies (also
indexed by string key).

Values are defined by:

::

    message ConfigValue {
        uint64 version = 1;
        bytes value = 2;
        string mod_policy = 3;
    }

Policies are defined by:

::

    message ConfigPolicy {
        uint64 version = 1;
        Policy policy = 2;
        string mod_policy = 3;
    }

Note that Values, Policies, and Groups all have a ``version`` and a
``mod_policy``. The ``version`` of an element is incremented each time
that element is modified. The ``mod_policy`` is used to govern the
required signatures to modify that element. For Groups, modification is
adding or removing elements to the Values, Policies, or Groups maps (or
changing the ``mod_policy``). For Values and Policies, modification is
changing the Value and Policy fields respectively (or changing the
``mod_policy``). Each element's ``mod_policy`` is evaluated in the
context of the current level of the config. Consider the following
example mod policies defined at ``Channel.Groups["Application"]`` (Here,
we use the Go map reference syntax, so
``Channel.Groups["Application"].Policies["policy1"]`` refers to the base
``Channel`` group's ``Application`` group's ``Policies`` map's
``policy1`` policy.)

* ``policy1`` maps to ``Channel.Groups["Application"].Policies["policy1"]``
* ``Org1/policy2`` maps to
  ``Channel.Groups["Application"].Groups["Org1"].Policies["policy2"]``
* ``/Channel/policy3`` maps to ``Channel.Policies["policy3"]``

Note that if a ``mod_policy`` references a policy which does not exist,
the item cannot be modified.

Configuration updates
---------------------

Configuration updates are submitted as an ``Envelope`` message of type
``HeaderType_CONFIG_UPDATE``. The ``Payload`` ``data`` of the
transaction is a marshaled ``ConfigUpdateEnvelope``. The ``ConfigUpdateEnvelope``
is defined as follows:

::

    message ConfigUpdateEnvelope {
        bytes config_update = 1;
        repeated ConfigSignature signatures = 2;
    }

The ``signatures`` field contains the set of signatures which authorizes
the config update. Its message definition is:

::

    message ConfigSignature {
        bytes signature_header = 1;
        bytes signature = 2;
    }

The ``signature_header`` is as defined for standard transactions, while
the signature is over the concatenation of the ``signature_header``
bytes and the ``config_update`` bytes from the ``ConfigUpdateEnvelope``
message.

The ``ConfigUpdateEnvelope`` ``config_update`` bytes are a marshaled
``ConfigUpdate`` message which is defined as follows:

::

    message ConfigUpdate {
        string channel_id = 1;
        ConfigGroup read_set = 2;
        ConfigGroup write_set = 3;
    }

The ``channel_id`` is the channel ID the update is bound for, this is
necessary to scope the signatures which support this reconfiguration.

The ``read_set`` specifies a subset of the existing configuration,
specified sparsely where only the ``version`` field is set and no other
fields must be populated. The particular ``ConfigValue`` ``value`` or
``ConfigPolicy`` ``policy`` fields should never be set in the
``read_set``. The ``ConfigGroup`` may have a subset of its map fields
populated, so as to reference an element deeper in the config tree. For
instance, to include the ``Application`` group in the ``read_set``, its
parent (the ``Channel`` group) must also be included in the read set,
but, the ``Channel`` group does not need to populate all of the keys,
such as the ``Orderer`` ``group`` key, or any of the ``values`` or
``policies`` keys.

The ``write_set`` specifies the pieces of configuration which are
modified. Because of the hierarchical nature of the configuration, a
write to an element deep in the hierarchy must contain the higher level
elements in its ``write_set`` as well. However, for any element in the
``write_set`` which is also specified in the ``read_set`` at the same
version, the element should be specified sparsely, just as in the
``read_set``.

For example, given the configuration:

::

    Channel: (version 0)
        Orderer (version 0)
        Application (version 3)
           Org1 (version 2)

To submit a configuration update which modifies ``Org1``, the
``read_set`` would be:

::

    Channel: (version 0)
        Application: (version 3)

and the ``write_set`` would be

::

    Channel: (version 0)
        Application: (version 3)
            Org1 (version 3)

When the ``CONFIG_UPDATE`` is received, the orderer computes the
resulting ``CONFIG`` by doing the following:

1. Verifies the ``channel_id`` and ``read_set``. All elements in the
   ``read_set`` must exist at the given versions.
2. Computes the update set by collecting all elements in the
   ``write_set`` which do not appear at the same version in the
   ``read_set``.
3. Verifies that each element in the update set increments the version
   number of the element update by exactly 1.
4. Verifies that the signature set attached to the
   ``ConfigUpdateEnvelope`` satisfies the ``mod_policy`` for each
   element in the update set.
5. Computes a new complete version of the config by applying the update
   set to the current config.
6. Writes the new config into a ``ConfigEnvelope`` which includes the
   ``CONFIG_UPDATE`` as the ``last_update`` field and the new config
   encoded in the ``config`` field, along with the incremented
   ``sequence`` value.
7. Writes the new ``ConfigEnvelope`` into a ``Envelope`` of type
   ``CONFIG``, and ultimately writes this as the sole transaction in a
   new configuration block.

When the peer (or any other receiver for ``Deliver``) receives this
configuration block, it should verify that the config was appropriately
validated by applying the ``last_update`` message to the current config
and verifying that the orderer-computed ``config`` field contains the
correct new configuration.

Permitted configuration groups and values
-----------------------------------------

Any valid configuration is a subset of the following configuration. Here
we use the notation ``peer.<MSG>`` to define a ``ConfigValue`` whose
``value`` field is a marshaled proto message of name ``<MSG>`` defined
in ``fabric-protos/peer/configuration.proto``. The notations
``common.<MSG>``, ``msp.<MSG>``, and ``orderer.<MSG>`` correspond
similarly, but with their messages defined in
``fabric-protos/common/configuration.proto``,
``fabric-protos/msp/mspconfig.proto``, and
``fabric-protos/orderer/configuration.proto`` respectively.

Note, that the keys ``{{org_name}}`` and ``{{consortium_name}}``
represent arbitrary names, and indicate an element which may be repeated
with different names.

            "Consortium":common.Consortium,
            "OrdererAddresses":common.OrdererAddresses,
        },
    }

Orderer system channel configuration
------------------------------------

The ordering system channel needs to define ordering parameters, and
consortiums for creating channels. There must be exactly one ordering
system channel for an ordering service, and it is the first channel to
be created (or more accurately bootstrapped). It is recommended never to
define an Application section inside of the ordering system channel
genesis configuration, but may be done for testing. Note that any member
with read access to the ordering system channel may see all channel
creations, so this channel's access should be restricted.

The ordering parameters are defined as the following subset of config:

::

    &ConfigGroup{
        Groups: map<string, *ConfigGroup> {
            "Orderer":&ConfigGroup{
                Groups:map<String, *ConfigGroup> {
                    {{org_name}}:&ConfigGroup{
                        Values:map<string, *ConfigValue>{
                            "MSP":msp.MSPConfig,
                        },
                    },
                },

                Values:map<string, *ConfigValue> {
                    "ConsensusType":orderer.ConsensusType,
                    "BatchSize":orderer.BatchSize,
                    "BatchTimeout":orderer.BatchTimeout,
                    "KafkaBrokers":orderer.KafkaBrokers,
                },
            },
        },

Each organization participating in ordering has a group element under
the ``Orderer`` group. This group defines a single parameter ``MSP``
which contains the cryptographic identity information for that
organization. The ``Values`` of the ``Orderer`` group determine how the
ordering nodes function. They exist per channel, so
``orderer.BatchTimeout`` for instance may be specified differently on
one channel than another.

At startup, the orderer is faced with a filesystem which contains
information for many channels. The orderer identifies the system channel
by identifying the channel with the consortiums group defined. The
consortiums group has the following structure.

::

    &ConfigGroup{
        Groups: map<string, *ConfigGroup> {
            "Consortiums":&ConfigGroup{
                Groups:map<String, *ConfigGroup> {
                    {{consortium_name}}:&ConfigGroup{
                        Groups:map<string, *ConfigGroup> {
                            {{org_name}}:&ConfigGroup{
                                Values:map<string, *ConfigValue>{
                                    "MSP":msp.MSPConfig,
                                },
                            },
                        },
                        Values:map<string, *ConfigValue> {
                            "ChannelCreationPolicy":common.Policy,
                        }
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },

Note that each consortium defines a set of members, just like the
organizational members for the ordering orgs. Each consortium also
defines a ``ChannelCreationPolicy``. This is a policy which is applied
to authorize channel creation requests. Typically, this value will be
set to an ``ImplicitMetaPolicy`` requiring that the new members of the
channel sign to authorize the channel creation. More details about
channel creation follow later in this document.

Application channel configuration
---------------------------------

Application configuration is for channels which are designed for
application type transactions. It is defined as follows:

::

    &ConfigGroup{
        Groups: map<string, *ConfigGroup> {
            "Application":&ConfigGroup{
                Groups:map<String, *ConfigGroup> {
                    {{org_name}}:&ConfigGroup{
                        Values:map<string, *ConfigValue>{
                            "MSP":msp.MSPConfig,
                            "AnchorPeers":peer.AnchorPeers,
                        },
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    }

Just like with the ``Orderer`` section, each organization is encoded as
a group. However, instead of only encoding the ``MSP`` identity
information, each org additionally encodes a list of ``AnchorPeers``.
This list allows the peers of different organizations to contact each
other for peer gossip networking.

The application channel encodes a copy of the orderer orgs and consensus
options to allow for deterministic updating of these parameters, so the
same ``Orderer`` section from the orderer system channel configuration
is included. However from an application perspective this may be largely
ignored.

Channel creation
----------------

When the orderer receives a ``CONFIG_UPDATE`` for a channel which does
not exist, the orderer assumes that this must be a channel creation
request and performs the following.

1. The orderer identifies the consortium which the channel creation
   request is to be performed for. It does this by looking at the
   ``Consortium`` value of the top level group.
2. The orderer verifies that the organizations included in the
   ``Application`` group are a subset of the organizations included in
   the corresponding consortium and that the ``ApplicationGroup`` is set
   to ``version`` ``1``.
3. The orderer verifies that if the consortium has members, that the new
   channel also has application members (creation consortiums and
   channels with no members is useful for testing only).
4. The orderer creates a template configuration by taking the
   ``Orderer`` group from the ordering system channel, and creating an
   ``Application`` group with the newly specified members and specifying
   its ``mod_policy`` to be the ``ChannelCreationPolicy`` as specified
   in the consortium config. Note that the policy is evaluated in the
   context of the new configuration, so a policy requiring ``ALL``
   members, would require signatures from all the new channel members,
   not all the members of the consortium.
5. The orderer then applies the ``CONFIG_UPDATE`` as an update to this
   template configuration. Because the ``CONFIG_UPDATE`` applies
   modifications to the ``Application`` group (its ``version`` is
   ``1``), the config code validates these updates against the
   ``ChannelCreationPolicy``. If the channel creation contains any other
   modifications, such as to an individual org's anchor peers, the
   corresponding mod policy for the element will be invoked.
6. The new ``CONFIG`` transaction with the new channel config is wrapped
   and sent for ordering on the ordering system channel. After ordering,
   the channel is created.
