"This document outlines the transactional mechanics that take place during"
" a standard asset exchange. The scenario includes two clients, A and B, "
"who are buying and selling radishes. They each have a peer on the network"
" through which they send their transactions and interact with the ledger."

msgid "**Assumptions**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:13
msgid ""
"This flow assumes that a channel is set up and running. The application "
"user has registered and enrolled with the organization’s Certificate "
"Authority (CA) and received back necessary cryptographic material, which "
"is used to authenticate to the network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:18
msgid ""
"The chaincode (containing a set of key value pairs representing the "
"initial state of the radish market) is installed on the peers and "
"deployed to the channel. The chaincode contains logic defining a set of "
"transaction instructions and the agreed upon price for a radish. An "
"endorsement policy has also been set for this chaincode, stating that "
"both ``peerA`` and ``peerB`` must endorse any transaction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:27
msgid "**Client A initiates a transaction**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:29
msgid ""
"What's happening? Client A is sending a request to purchase radishes. "
"This request targets ``peerA`` and ``peerB``, who are respectively "
"representative of Client A and Client B. The endorsement policy states "
"that both peers must endorse any transaction, therefore the request goes "
"to ``peerA`` and ``peerB``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:34
msgid ""
"Next, the transaction proposal is constructed. An application leveraging "
"a supported SDK (Node, Java, Python) utilizes one of the available API's "
"to generate a transaction proposal. The proposal is a request to invoke a"
" chaincode function with certain input parameters, with the intent of "
"reading and/or updating the ledger."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:40
msgid ""
"The SDK serves as a shim to package the transaction proposal into the "
"properly architected format (protocol buffer over gRPC) and takes the "
"user’s cryptographic credentials to produce a unique signature for this "
"transaction proposal."

msgid "**Endorsing peers verify signature & execute the transaction**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:49
msgid ""
"The endorsing peers verify (1) that the transaction proposal is well "
"formed, (2) it has not been submitted already in the past (replay-attack "
"protection), (3) the signature is valid (using the MSP), and (4) that the"
" submitter (Client A, in the example) is properly authorized to perform "
"the proposed operation on that channel (namely, each endorsing peer "
"ensures that the submitter satisfies the channel's *Writers* policy). The"
" endorsing peers take the transaction proposal inputs as arguments to the"
" invoked chaincode's function. The chaincode is then executed against the"
" current state database to produce transaction results including a "
"response value, read set, and write set (i.e. key/value pairs "
"representing an asset to create or update). No updates are made to the "
"ledger at this point. The set of these values, along with the endorsing "
"peer’s signature is passed back as a “proposal response” to the SDK which"
" parses the payload for the application to consume."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:63
msgid ""
"The MSP is a peer component that allows peers to verify transaction "
"requests arriving from clients and to sign transaction results "
"(endorsements). The writing policy is defined at channel creation time "
"and determines which users are entitled to submit a transaction to that "
"channel. For more information about membership, check out our "
":doc:`membership/membership` documentation."

msgid "**Proposal responses are inspected**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:74
msgid ""
"The application verifies the endorsing peer signatures and compares the "
"proposal responses to determine if the proposal responses are the same. "
"If the chaincode is only querying the ledger, the application would only "
"inspect the query response and would typically not submit the transaction"
" to the ordering service. If the client application intends to submit the"
" transaction to the ordering service to update the ledger, the "
"application determines if the specified endorsement policy has been "
"fulfilled before submitting (i.e. did peerA and peerB both endorse). The "
"architecture is such that even if an application chooses not to inspect "
"responses or otherwise forwards an unendorsed transaction, the "
"endorsement policy will still be enforced by peers and upheld at the "
"commit validation phase."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:90
msgid ""
"The application “broadcasts” the transaction proposal and response within"
" a “transaction message” to the ordering service. The transaction will "
"contain the read/write sets, the endorsing peers signatures and the "
"Channel ID. The ordering service does not need to inspect the entire "
"content of a transaction in order to perform its operation, it simply "
"receives transactions from all channels in the network, orders them "
"chronologically by channel, and creates blocks of transactions per "
"channel."

msgid "**Transaction is validated and committed**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:102
msgid ""
"The blocks of transactions are “delivered” to all peers on the channel.  "
"The transactions within the block are validated to ensure endorsement "
"policy is fulfilled and to ensure that there have been no changes to "
"ledger state for read set variables since the read set was generated by "
"the transaction execution. Transactions in the block are tagged as being "
"valid or invalid."

"Each peer appends the block to the channel’s chain, and for each valid "
"transaction the write sets are committed to current state database. An "
"event is emitted by each peer to notify the client application that the "
"transaction (invocation) has been immutably appended to the chain, as "
"well as notification of whether the transaction was validated or "
"invalidated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/txflow.rst:118
msgid ""
"Applications should listen for the transaction event after submitting a "
"transaction, for example by using the ``submitTransaction`` API, which "
"automatically listen for transaction events. Without listening for "
"transaction events, you will not know whether your transaction has "
"actually been ordered, validated, and committed to the ledger."
