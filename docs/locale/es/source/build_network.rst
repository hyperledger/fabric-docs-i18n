Building Your First Network
===========================

.. note:: The Build your first network (BYFN) tutorial has been removed.
   If you are getting started with Hyperledger Fabric and would like to deploy
   a basic network, see :doc:`test_network`.
   If you are deploying Fabric in production, see the guide for :doc:`deployment_guide_overview`.

   You can still find the BYFN tutorial in earlier Fabric documentation versions:

   - `Fabric 2.1 <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.1/build_network.html>`_
   - `Fabric 1.4 <https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/build_network.html>`_
