"As mentioned in MSP description, MSPs may be configured with a set of "
"root certificate authorities (rCAs), and optionally a set of intermediate"
" certificate authorities (iCAs). An MSP's iCA certificates must be signed"
" by **exactly one** of the MSP's rCAs or iCAs. An MSP's configuration may"
" contain a certificate revocation list, or CRL. If any of the MSP's root "
"certificate authorities are listed in the CRL, then the MSP's "
"configuration must not include any iCA that is also included in the CRL, "
"or the MSP setup will fail."

"Each rCA is the root of a certification tree. That is, each rCA may be "
"the signer of the certificates of one or more iCAs, and these iCAs will "
"be the signer either of other iCAs or of user-certificates. Here are a "
"few examples::"

"The default MPS implementation accepts as valid identities X.509 "
"certificates signed by the appropriate authorities. In the diagram above,"
" only certificates signed by iCA11, iCA12, iCA2, iCA3, and rCA3 will be "
"considered valid. Certificates signed by internal nodes will be rejected."

"Notice that the validity of a certificate is also affected, in a similar "
"way, if one or more organizational units are specified in the MSP "
"configuration. Recall that an organizational unit is specified in an MSP "
"configuration as a pair of two values, say (parent-cert, ou-string) "
"representing the certificate authority that certifies that organizational"
" unit, and the actual organizational unit identifier, respectively. If a "
"certificate C is signed by an iCA or rCA for which an organizational unit"
" has been specified in the MSP configuration, then C is considered valid "
"if, among other requirements, it includes ou-string as part of its OU "
"field."
