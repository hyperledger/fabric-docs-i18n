"Connection options are used in conjunction with a connection profile to "
"control precisely how a gateway interacts with a network. Using a gateway"
" allows an application to focus on business logic rather than network "
"topology."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:19
msgid ""
"A connection option specifies a particular aspect of a gateway's "
"behaviour. Gateways are important for many reasons, the primary being to "
"allow an application to focus on business logic and smart contracts, "
"while it manages interactions with the many components of a network."
msgstr ""

"profile.scenario The different interaction points where connection "
"options control behaviour. These options are explained fully in the text."

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:28
msgid ""
"One example of a connection option might be to specify that the gateway "
"used by the issue application should use identity Isabella to submit "
"transactions to the papernet network. Another might be that a gateway "
"should wait for all three nodes from MagnetoCorp to confirm a transaction"
" has been committed returning control. Connection options allow "
"applications to specify the precise behaviour of a gateway's interaction "
"with the network. Without a gateway, applications need to do a lot more "
"work; gateways save you time, make your application more readable, and "
"less error prone."

"We'll describe the full set of connection options available to an "
"application in a moment; let's first see how they are specified by the "
"sample MagnetoCorp issue application:"

"See how the identity and wallet options are simple properties of the "
"connectionOptions object. They have values userName and wallet "
"respectively, which were set earlier in the code. Contrast these options "
"with the eventHandlerOptions option which is an object in its own right. "
"It has two properties: commitTimeout: 100 (measured in seconds) and "
"strategy: EventStrategies.MSPID_SCOPE_ANYFORTX."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionoptions.md:66
msgid ""
"See how connectionOptions is passed to a gateway as a complement to "
"connectionProfile; the network is identified by the connection profile "
"and the options specify precisely how the gateway should interact with "
"it. Let's now look at the available options."
