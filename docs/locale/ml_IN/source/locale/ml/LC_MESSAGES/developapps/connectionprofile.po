"A connection profile describes a set of components, including peers, "
"orderers and certificate authorities in a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain "
"network. It also contains channel and organization information relating "
"to these components. A connection profile is primarily used by an "
"application to configure a gateway that handles all network interactions,"
" allowing it to focus on business logic. A connection profile is normally"
" created by an administrator who understands the network topology."

msgid ""
"A connection profile is used to configure a gateway. Gateways are "
"important for many reasons, the primary being to simplify an "
"application's interaction with a network channel."

"profile.scenario Two applications, issue and buy, use gateways 1&2 "
"configured with connection profiles 1&2. Each profile describes a "
"different subset of MagnetoCorp and DigiBank network components. Each "
"connection profile must contain sufficient information for a gateway to "
"interact with the network on behalf of the issue and buy applications. "
"See the text for a detailed explanation."

"A connection profile contains a description of a network view, expressed "
"in a technical syntax, which can either be JSON or YAML. In this topic, "
"we use the YAML representation, as it's easier for you to read. Static "
"gateways need more information than dynamic gateways because the latter "
"can use service discovery to dynamically augment the information in a "
"connection profile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:39
msgid ""
"A connection profile should not be an exhaustive description of a network"
" channel; it just needs to contain enough information sufficient for a "
"gateway that's using it. In the network above, connection profile 1 needs"
" to contain at least the endorsing organizations and peers for the issue "
"transaction, as well as identifying the peers that will notify the "
"gateway when the transaction has been committed to the ledger."

"It's easiest to think of a connection profile as describing a view of the"
" network. It could be a comprehensive view, but that's unrealistic for a "
"few reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:62
msgid ""
"A static connection profile is normally created by an administrator who "
"understands the network topology in detail. That's because a static "
"profile can contain quite a lot of information, and an administrator "
"needs to capture this in the corresponding connection profile. In "
"contrast, dynamic profiles minimize the amount of definition required and"
" therefore can be a better choice for developers who want to get going "
"quickly, or administrators who want to create a more responsive gateway. "
"Connection profiles are created in either the YAML or JSON format using "
"an editor of choice."

"After loading some required classes, see how the paperNet.yaml gateway "
"file is loaded from the file system, converted to a JSON object using the"
" yaml.safeLoad() method, and used to configure a gateway using its "
"connect() method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:92
msgid ""
"By configuring a gateway with this connection profile, the issue "
"application is providing the gateway with the relevant network topology "
"it should use to process transactions. That's because the connection "
"profile contains sufficient information about the PaperNet channels, "
"organizations, peers, orderers and CAs to ensure transactions can be "
"successfully processed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:98
msgid ""
"It's good practice for a connection profile to define more than one peer "
"for any given organization -- it prevents a single point of failure. This"
" practice also applies to dynamic gateways; to provide more than one "
"starting point for service discovery."

msgid ""
"A DigiBank buy application would typically configure its gateway with a "
"similar connection profile, but with some important differences. Some "
"elements will be the same, such as the channel; some elements will "
"overlap, such as the endorsing peers. Other elements will be completely "
"different, such as notification peers or certificate authorities for "
"example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developapps/connectionprofile.md:109
msgid ""
"The connectionOptions passed to a gateway complement the connection "
"profile. They allow an application to declare how it would like the "
"gateway to use the connection profile. They are interpreted by the SDK to"
" control interaction patterns with network components, for example to "
"select which identity to connect with, or which peers to use for event "
"notifications. Read about the list of available connection options and "
"when to use them."

msgid ""
"To help you understand the structure of a connection profile, we're going"
" to step through an example for the network shown above. Its connection "
"profile is based on the PaperNet commercial paper sample, and stored in "
"the GitHub repository. For convenience, we've reproduced it below. You "
"will find it helpful to display it in another browser window as you now "
"read about it:"

"Now you've understood a connection profile for MagnetoCorp, you might "
"like to look at a corresponding profile for DigiBank. Locate where the "
"profile is the same as MagnetoCorp's, see where it's similar, and finally"
" where it's different. Think about why these differences make sense for "
"DigiBank applications."

"That's everything you need to know about connection profiles. In summary,"
" a connection profile defines sufficient channels, organizations, peers, "
"orderers and certificate authorities for an application to configure a "
"gateway. The gateway allows the application to focus on business logic "
"rather than the details of the network topology."
