"A Hyperledger Fabric network channel can constantly change.  The peer, "
"orderer and CA components, contributed by the different organizations in "
"the network, will come and go. Reasons for this include increased or "
"reduced business demand, and both planned and unplanned outages. A "
"gateway relieves an application of this burden, allowing it to focus on "
"the business problem it is trying to solve."

"gateway.scenario A MagnetoCorp and DigiBank applications (issue and buy) "
"delegate their respective network interactions to their gateways. Each "
"gateway understands the network channel topology comprising the multiple "
"peers and orderers of two organizations MagnetoCorp and DigiBank, leaving"
" applications to focus on business logic. Peers can talk to each other "
"both within and across organizations using the gossip protocol."

"You might ask yourself whether a static or dynamic gateway is better? The"
" trade-off is between predictability and responsiveness. Static networks "
"will always behave the same way, as they perceive the network as "
"unchanging. In this sense they are predictable -- they will always use "
"the same peers and orderers if they are available. Dynamic networks are "
"more responsive as they understand how the network changes -- they can "
"use newly added peers and orderers, which brings extra resilience and "
"scalability, at potentially some cost in predictability. In general it's "
"fine to use dynamic networks, and indeed this the default mode for "
"gateways."

"Note that the same connection profile can be used statically or "
"dynamically. Clearly, if a profile is going to be used statically, it "

"population."

"Both styles of gateway are transparent to the application; the "
"application program design does not change whether static or dynamic "
"gateways are used. This also means that some applications may use service"
" discovery, while others may not. In general using dynamic discovery "
"means less definition and more intelligence by the SDK; it is the "
"default."

"Static gateways define a fixed view of a network. In the MagnetoCorp "

" In both cases, a gateway must define a view of the network sufficient to"
" get commercial paper transactions endorsed and distributed."

"It's worth bearing in mind that a static gateway represents a view of a "

"Dynamic gateways define a small, fixed starting point for a network. In "

"If service discovery is selected by an application, the topology defined "
"in the gateway file is augmented with that produced by this process. "
"Service discovery starts with the gateway definition, and finds all the "
"connected peers and orderers within the MagnetoCorp organization using "
"the gossip protocol. If anchor peers have been defined for a channel, "
"then service discovery will use the gossip protocol across organizations "
"to discover components within the connected organization. This process "
"will also discover smart contracts installed on peers and their "
"endorsement policies defined at a channel level. As with static gateways,"
" the discovered network must be sufficient to get commercial paper "
"transactions endorsed and distributed."
