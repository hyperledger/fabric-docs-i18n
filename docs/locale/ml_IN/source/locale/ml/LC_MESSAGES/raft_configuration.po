"Recall, each channel has its own instance of a Raft protocol running. "
"Thus, a Raft node must be referenced in the configuration of each channel"

"The Raft orderer supports dynamic (meaning, while the channel is being "
"serviced) addition and removal of nodes as long as only one node is added"
" or removed at a time. Note that your cluster must be operational and "
"able to achieve consensus before you attempt to reconfigure it. For "
"instance, if you have three nodes, and two nodes fail, you will not be "
"able to reconfigure your cluster to remove those nodes. Similarly, if you"
" have one failed node in a channel with three nodes, you should not "
"attempt to rotate a certificate, as this would induce a second fault. As "
"a rule, you should never attempt any configuration changes to the Raft "
"consenters, such as adding or removing a consenter, or rotating a "
"consenter's certificate unless all consenters are online and healthy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/raft_configuration.md:196

"If you do decide to change these parameters, it is recommended to only "
"attempt such a change during a maintenance cycle. Problems are most "
"likely to occur when a configuration is attempted in clusters with only a"
" few nodes while a node is down. For example, if you have three nodes in "
"your consenter set and one of them is down, it means you have two out of "
"three nodes alive. If you extend the cluster to four nodes while in this "
"state, you will have only two out of four nodes alive, which is not a "
"quorum. The fourth node won't be able to onboard because nodes can only "
"onboard to functioning clusters (unless the total size of the cluster is "
"one or two)."
