"In cases where a group of organizations on a channel need to keep data "
"private from other organizations on that channel, they have the option to"
" create a new channel comprising just the organizations who need access "
"to the data. However, creating separate channels in each of these cases "
"creates additional administrative overhead (maintaining chaincode "
"versions, policies, MSPs, etc), and doesn't allow for use cases in which "
"you want all channel participants to see a transaction while keeping a "
"portion of the data private."

"That's why Fabric offers the ability to create private data collections, "
"which allow a defined subset of organizations on a channel the ability to"

"Collection members may decide to share the private data with other "

"In many scenarios private data keys/values in one collection may need to "
"be shared with other channel members or with other private data "
"collections, for example when you need to transact on private data with a"
" channel member or group of channel members who were not included in the "
"original private data collection. The receiving parties will typically "
"want to verify the private data against the on-chain hashes as part of "
"the transaction."

"There are several aspects of private data collections that enable the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:168
msgid ""
"This ability to share and verify private data should be considered when "
"designing applications and the associated private data collections. While"
" you can certainly create sets of multilateral private data collections "
"to share data among various combinations of channel members, this "
"approach may result in a large number of collections that need to be "
"defined. Alternatively, consider using a smaller number of private data "
"collections (e.g. one collection per organization, or one collection per "
"pair of organizations), and then sharing private data with other channel "
"members, or with other collections as the need arises. Starting in Fabric"
" v2.0, implicit organization-specific collections are available for any "
"chaincode to utilize, so that you don't even have to define these per-"
"organization collections when deploying chaincode."

"some of the sharing patterns that could be leveraged in chaincode "
"applications:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/private-data/private-data.md:256

"Coupled with the patterns above, it is worth noting that transactions "

"The basic asset transfer scenario could be extended for other "

"payment record is available to satisfy payment versus delivery "
"requirements, or verify that a bank has submitted a letter of credit, "
"prior to the execution of the transfer chaincode. And instead of "
"transactors directly hosting peers, they could transact through custodian"
" organizations who are running peers."

"For very sensitive data, even the parties sharing the private data might "

"In some of these cases, the private data only needs to exist on the "

"settled, contract fulfilled, etc)."

"To support these use cases, private data can be purged if it has not been"
