"resets all channels in the peer to the genesis block, i.e., the first "
"block in the channel. The command also records the pre-reset height of "
"each channel in the file system. Note that the peer process should be "
"stopped while executing this command. If the peer process is running, "
"this command detects that and returns an error instead of performing the "
"reset. When the peer is started after performing the reset, the peer will"
" fetch the blocks for each channel which were removed by the reset "
"command (either from other peers or orderers) and commit the blocks up to"
